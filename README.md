# Temperature-Convertor
Using Javascript, HTML and a bit of CSS, I have made a project that can do conversion between three primary units of temperature - Kelvin, Celsius and Fahrenheit.
It's an active site where you don't have to click the convert button repeatedly, Instead while you input the value in one box, the other boxes get converted respectively
without any delay and you don't have to refresh it everytime you want to convert a new temperature.
